## College Project

Programmed in Java using IntelliJ Idea, the aim of the program was to make a Library system with different scopes of user being Admin, Casual and Full - the differences allowed the user to borrow more or less depending on access type. 

The program also logged the login date/time and logout date/time as well as allowed Admin members to update the stock count.
